# Gnosis

This repository acts as an aggregator for various components that help me learn and better navigate the world.

Together, they constitute a tool I call Gnosis. The name comes from the Greek word for knowledge.

## Akti

A web application, written in Typescript with Svelte, functioning as a portal to discovery:

* It randomly chooses several articles from my read list every time it loads.
* Daily, chooses some tools - and makes me remember they exist.
* ( Planned ) Spaced repetition for known good articles.
* ( Planned ) Visualization of my knowledge in the form of a graph.

Reasoning:

* Helps me catch up with my read list
* Helps me focus
  * It is a well-known fact that I have the attention span of a labrador puppy.
  * Akti is my new-tab destination - I can't be distracted by youtube/twitch if something else distracts me before.
